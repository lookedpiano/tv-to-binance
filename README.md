# tv-to-binance ‚Äì Automated Trading Example
Webhook to send TradingView alerts to Binance

This repository contains sample code for the automated connection between **TradingView Alerts**, a **Python Flask web service**, and the **Binance API**.  
It is intended solely for **educational and demonstration purposes** as part of my Bitcoin and crypto consulting services.

## Usage

1. Create a TradingView account and define your own alerts

## Purpose

The goal is to **demonstrate in a practical manner** to clients how automated trading can be implemented technically as part of my consulting services.  
The focus is on **education and self-empowerment**‚Äînot on the execution of trades by me.



## Example alert

TradingView alert message to buy with a fixed amount of 1000 USDT or to sell 80 % of the base asset:
{
  "action": "{{strategy.order.action}}",
  "symbol": "{{ticker}}",
  "buy_funds_amount": "1000",
  "sell_crypto_pct": "0.8",
  "client_secret": "-your client secret-"
}

TradingView alert message to buy 34 % of available USDT or to sell a fixed amount of 100 of the base asset:
{
  "action": "{{strategy.order.action}}",
  "symbol": "{{ticker}}",
  "buy_funds_pct": "0.34",
  "sell_crypto_amount": "100",
  "client_secret": "-your client secret-"
}

TradingView alert message to buy 77 ADAs directly or to sell ETH worth 150 USDT:
{
  "action": "{{strategy.order.action}}",
  "symbol": "{{ticker}}",
  "buy_crypto_amount": "77",
  "sell_funds_amount": "150",
  "client_secret": "-your client secret-"
}

Legend:
- action: Returns the string "buy" or "sell" for the executed order.
- symbol: Returns the trading pair, e.g. BTCUSDT, ETHUSDC, ADAUSDT, etc.
- buy_funds_pct: A decimal fraction (0 < buy_funds_pct ‚â§ 1) indicating what fraction of your available quote asset balance (e.g. USDT or USDC) should be used for the buy order (Example: 0.05 = invest 5 % of your available quote balance.).
- buy_funds_amount: An explicit numeric value specifying the exact quote asset amount (e.g. USDT) to spend on the buy order. Must not exceed your available quote asset balance.
- buy_crypto_amount: An explicit numeric value specifying the exact base asset amount to buy (e.g. buy 77 ADA or 1.2 ETH). The system automatically calculates how much quote asset (USDT, USDC, etc.) is needed for the purchase based on the current market price.
- sell_crypto_pct: A decimal fraction (0 < sell_crypto_pct ‚â§ 1) indicating what fraction of your available base asset (e.g. ADA in ADAUSDT, ETH in ETHUSDC) should be sold. (Example: 0.25 = sell 25 % of your ADA holdings.)
- sell_crypto_amount: An explicit numeric value specifying the exact base asset amount to sell. Must not exceed your available base asset balance.
- sell_funds_amount: An explicit numeric value specifying the exact quote asset amount you want to receive from the sale (e.g. sell ETH worth 150 USDT). The system automatically calculates how much of the base asset must be sold to reach this target.
- client_secret: Defines your personally defined client secret for authentication.

Rules:
- If the action is "buy" or "sell", exactly one of the corresponding fields must be supplied:
  - For BUY orders:
    - buy_funds_pct ‚Äì percentage of quote balance to use, or
    - buy_funds_amount ‚Äì exact quote amount to spend, or
    - buy_crypto_amount ‚Äì exact base asset amount to buy
  - For SELL orders:
    - sell_crypto_pct ‚Äì percentage of base holdings to sell, or
    - sell_crypto_amount ‚Äì exact base asset amount to sell, or
    - sell_funds_amount ‚Äì target quote amount to receive
- If multiple fields for the same side are present ‚Üí payload is rejected.
